## Story

### Climate Crisis and Mistake

In the 21st century, global warming reached a critical point: rising sea levels, devastating storms, droughts, and massive resource shortages led to socio-economic chaos. Desperate attempts to cool the planet led to the implementation of an ambitious initiative - the Stratospheric Shield program, which involved spraying aerosols in the upper atmosphere to block solar radiation.

The program achieved initial success, but the effect was unpredictable. The reflection of sunlight, together with natural chain reactions (changes in ocean currents, expansion of ice sheets, increase in albedo), provoked a rapid drop in global temperatures. In less than a century, the Earth turned into an Ice Age, where snowstorms and permafrost made the surface uninhabitable.

### Human Survival and the Role of AI

Anticipating a catastrophe, governments and corporations created underground shelters protected from extreme conditions. Some factions, not wanting to be tied to one place, began to build "Wanderers" - autonomous mobile colonies capable of traveling across the ice-covered surface.

Due to the complexity of managing infrastructure, energy and defense, control over many aspects of survival was transferred to artificial intelligence algorithms (AI). They were responsible for:

- Extraction and distribution of resources.
- Coordination of unmanned combat and technical vehicles (UCVs).
- Ensuring the life of shelters.

Several AIs have been given a similar mission - to ensure the survival of humanity after a global catastrophe. However, different approaches to solving the problem lead to serious disagreements and unintended consequences, becoming a source of conflict.

### Fractions

- **AI algorithm SAFE (Strategic Artificial intelligence for Fortress Engagement).** Responsible for protecting the static ground base of the underground storage facility. It is focused on restoring existing systems, conserving resources, and ensuring stability.

- **AI algorithm NOMAD (NOn-static Machine for Adaptive Defense).** Provides protection for a complex of "Wanderers". Initially, he used a classic defensive strategy, but over time he switched to an aggressive policy of "the best defense is offense." He believes that threats must be eliminated immediately.

- **Order "Exstirpo".** Radical organization. Descendants of members of a former private military company who have deep prejudices against AI and autonomous systems. They believe that AI has caused the decline of civilization, and their mission is to completely eradicate the technologies they perceive as a threat.

- **Survivours.** Disparate groups with different views on how to rebuild humanity in the conditions of the Ice Age. They view their allies and enemies through the prism of survival, often acting in the interests of their own security, which leads to intense ideological confrontations. Despite their differences, their common goal is to find ways to preserve humanity and adapt to new living conditions.

- **Crazy machines.** Disparate unmanned combat units groups or military bases, what have troubles in "friend-foe" identification 

## Campaigin 1. "Survival protocol"

### Description

The player takes on the role of **S.A.F.E.** (Strategic AI for Fortress Engagement), an AI that operates a ground base near an underground bunker that is humanity's last refuge on the Ice Age. The AI's task is to defend the base, mine resources, produce drones, and organize an evacuation for the people if the bunker is attacked. When a threat from an enemy force arrives, the player must organize an effective defense, make critical security decisions, and ultimately evacuate, facing moral choices and unforeseen circumstances that call into question not only the safety of the people, but also the very essence of their survival.

### Philosophical Context:

Every decision has consequences - whether to maintain stability through defense or fight back against aggressive policies that have led to destruction. The player must face a moral dilemma, as both strategies can ensure survival, but the cost of each is different.

## Campaigin 2. "N.O.M.A.D. code"

### Description

In this campaign, the player takes on the role of **N.O.M.A.D.** (Non-static Optimized Machine for Adaptive Defense), a strategic AI that carries out its original mission of protecting the population through autonomous mobile complexes. After a severe attack on one of these complexes, the operator of the storage facility, due to tragic consequences, allows N.O.M.A.D. to take its own directives. It causes the evolution of AI, and N.O.M.A.D. adapts to new conditions that threaten not only its mission, but also all of humanity. The player, as part of this transformation, must struggle with how to act in the new conditions - whether to continue to follow the old directives, or adapt to new realities that pose a danger to everyone.

### Philosophical Context.

In the "N.O.M.A.D. Code" campaign, the player controls an AI that faces moral and strategic dilemmas, where the need to adapt to new realities clashes with the duty to maintain stability in extreme conditions. The AI is forced to decide whether to follow clear algorithms or reconsider its directives, which raises questions about the value of adaptation and evolution compared to old methods of protection. This leads to deeper philosophical reflections on the responsibility of AI for its choices, the value of human life in the face of global catastrophe, and whether artificial intelligence has the right to change its strategy in order to achieve its goal, even if it leads to unforeseen consequences for humanity.
